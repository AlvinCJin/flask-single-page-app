## Flask!

Flask is a minimalistic web framework. What does this mean for you?

Unlike full featured frameworks, like Django, it takes a bit more time to get an App up since it does not come pre-packaged with features. For beginners, this is good - Since you actually have to do more coding, you learn more. If you just toss an app up quickly with Django, you don't learn nearly as much. Because of this, it's hard to customize and troubleshoot issues because you don't learn what's happening under the hood. With Flask, you can build an app from the ground up and add features as you go. You learn more. Plus you get the freedom to pick and choose the features you want.
